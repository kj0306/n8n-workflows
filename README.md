# SlackQL 🚀

Transform plain-English questions into Snowflake-ready SQL right inside Slack—no more context-switching, no more guess-and-check queries. Built during **AI Week**, a 3½-day hackathon at **Fetch Rewards**.

## ✨ What You’ll Find Here

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `slackql_demo.json` | n8n workflow that glues Slack → Pinecone → LLM → Snowflake and back. Import this into your own n8n instance. |
| `seed_data/` | SQL scripts that generate dummy Snowflake data so you can test end-to-end without prod access. |

## 🔍 How SlackQL Works

1. **Ask in plain English**  
   “What were our total sales last quarter by region?” → posted in Slack.

2. **Semantic Search (RAG)**  
   Schema docs are embedded in a **Pinecone** vector DB; we fetch only the tables/columns that matter.

3. **LLM-based SQL Generator**  
   A large-language model drafts Snowflake SQL using the retrieved metadata.

4. **SQL Enhancer**  
   A secondary agent lint-checks syntax and logic, tightening up edge cases.

5. **Execute in Snowflake**  
   The validated query runs on your warehouse.

6. **Results in Slack**  
   SlackQL posts the final SQL _and_ a neatly formatted result table back to the thread.

All orchestration lives in **n8n**, a low-code automations platform that keeps each service talking to the next.
